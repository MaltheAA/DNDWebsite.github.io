        <p>On this site we will walkthrough how to create a character</p>
            <p>from character creation to combat</p>
            <br>
            <p>We will start with Character creation</p>
            <p>You start with picking a race their are many races with different abilities, that affects gameplay</p>
            <p>we will start by picking the high elf race which can get a cantrip which is magic like firebolt</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now that we have our race we will pick a class from the list of classes are as following</p>

                <li>Fighter</li>

                <li>ranger</li>

                <li>rogue</li>
                
                <li>barbarian</li>

                <li>Monk</li>

                <li>Paladin</li>

                <li>Bard</li>

                <li>druid</li>

                <li>cleric</li>

                <li>wizard</li>

                <li>sorcerrer</li>

                <li>Warlock</li>

                <li>Artificer</li>

                <p>These are the classes thats avaible in DND we will pick a cleric since it is a spellcaster</p>
                <p>Now that we have our class we need to add points in different stats.</p>

                <li>Strength</li>

                <li>Dexterity</li>

                <li>Constitution</li>

                <li>Intelligence</li>

                <li>wisdom</li>

                <li>Charisma</li>

                    <p>So since we have a limited amount of stats to use i will give this cleric these stats</p>
                    
                <li>Strength 8</li>

                <li>Dexterity 13</li>

                <li>Constitution 12</li>

                <li>Intelligence 15</li>

                <li>wisdom 14</li>

                <li>Charisma 10</li>

                <p>Now that our character has the stats we will go to decription, which is how our character look, age, backstory</p>
                <p>in Short its were we descripe our character</p>

                <p>Now we got equipment, their is starting equipment you can choose thats defined per class like for cleric its a mace</p>
                <P>And starter armour like chain mail for the cleric, along with a arcane focus for spellcasting.</P>

                <P>And this is how you create a character in DND</P>
