        <p>So we will now teach how to play DnD</p>

        <p>Step one roleplay</p>
        <p>Just a good common rule the Dungeon Master got the final word always</p>
        <br>
        <p>So roleplay is were you act as your character outside combat, like you are in a prison with bars, how will you break out</p>
        <p>You as a player should them roleplay on how to escape like it was a child play</p>

        <br>

        <p>spell slots if you are a spellcaster you will have spellslots wich determines how many spells you can cast and what tier</p>
        <p>every second level you go up as a spellcaster you gain access to new spells, spellslots refresh after what is called a long rest</p>
<br>
        <p>Combat</p>
        <p>Combat in DND is turn based, when its your turn, we use the cleric from character creation, we cast firebolt it is a cantrip</p>
        <p>and does not use a spell slot. We role the hit dice which affects if we hit the monster or not. And than we roll Damage if we hit</p>
